# Film Industry Analysis for Microsoft

#Author: Joan Wambua

## Project Overview

Microsoft is venturing into the realm of original video content creation by establishing a new movie studio. However, with limited expertise in the field, they are in need of insights to guide their filmmaking endeavors. The challenge at hand is to identify the types of films that are currently performing exceptionally well at the box office. This exploration aims to provide actionable insights that will empower Microsoft's movie studio leadership to make informed decisions on the genre and style of films to produce. By understanding the key factors contributing to box office success, Microsoft can strategically enter the entertainment industry and create content that resonates with audiences and maximizes profitability.

### Business Problem

Microsoft is starting a movie studio but doesn't know what movies to make. They want to find out which movie types are popular at the box office. Their new movie studio leadership will be able make informed decisions on the genre and style of films to produce, allowing them to enter the Film Industry and compete effectively in the entertainment industry.

### Data

3 different datasets are used for this Exploratory Data Analysis. These include;

1. bom.movie_gross; which entails the domestic and foreign gross revenue figures different movies earned after production. This particular dataset will guide Microsoft to understand which movies and genres earn more and which ones to invest in.
2. title.basics; which entails titles of movies and their genres. This file will especially guide Microsoft to understand in depth about the movie genres that are in the industry.
3. title.ratings; which includes the average ratings a movie gets once it is released and also the number of votes it acquires. This dataset will show Microsoft which movies do well in the industry by observing those with the highest rating and votes.

### Methods

This project used Exploratory Descriptive Analysis to pinpoint which movies do well in the industry, their genres, how much revenue they get and, provides tangible insight to Microsoft on how where to kickoff their movie selection.

### Results
1. Foreign gross income is more than Domestic gross income.
2. The genres with the most votes are Drama, Action and Adventure.
3. Top genres that bring in the most income are Action, Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi and Animation.

## Recommendations
This analysis leads to three recommendations for Microsoft to do well in this industry;
1. Microsoft should gain a clear understanding of the audience preferences at the beginning. Since the bigger audience is international, it needs to study the audience and translate this into the movies like themes and having film subtitles accompanied with the movies. This also translates to being culture sensitive so that the organization can reach a wider audience and be able to return more.
2. Microsoft should look into Animations, Dramas, Sci-Fi, Adventures and Action movies, as they have proven to be the genres with the highest ratings and most income. However, a successful genre is usually backed by a very good story. Therefore, the organization should invest in world class writes and producers to make these genres successful.
3. Since this is the start of a new venture for Microsoft, at least half of its success would be based on Marketing and Promotion. Effective marketing and promotion strategies can significantly impact a movie's success and generate buzz and attract viewers, leading to higher vote counts.

## Further Steps
This analysis has only touched on a few factors such as genres, total gross revenue, number of votes and weighter average ratings. Because of this, the problem is not fully solved. More factors that need to be analyzed and also contribute to the performance of a movie studio include Release Timing, Budget Allocation, Film Industry Trends, Cast and Critical Reviews.
