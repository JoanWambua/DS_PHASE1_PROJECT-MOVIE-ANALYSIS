# Film Industry Analysis for Microsoft

#Author: Joan Wambua

## Project Overview

Microsoft is venturing into the realm of original video content creation by establishing a new movie studio. However, with limited expertise in the field, they are in need of insights to guide their filmmaking endeavors. The challenge at hand is to identify the types of films that are currently performing exceptionally well at the box office. This exploration aims to provide actionable insights that will empower Microsoft's movie studio leadership to make informed decisions on the genre and style of films to produce. By understanding the key factors contributing to box office success, Microsoft can strategically enter the entertainment industry and create content that resonates with audiences and maximizes profitability.

### Business Problem

Microsoft is starting a movie studio but doesn't know what movies to make. They want to find out which movie types are popular at the box office. Their new movie studio leadership will be able make informed decisions on the genre and style of films to produce, allowing them to enter the Film Industry and compete effectively in the entertainment industry.

### Data

3 different datasets in this repository are used for this Exploratory Data Analysis. These include;

1. bom.movie_gross; which entails the domestic and foreign gross revenue figures different movies earned after production. This particular dataset will guide Microsoft to understand which movies and genres earn more and which ones to invest in.
2. title.basics.tsv.gz; which entails titles of movies and their genres. This file will especially guide Microsoft to understand in depth about the movie genres that are in the industry.
3. title.ratings.tsv.gz; which inludes the average ratings a movie gets once it is released and also the number of votes it acquires. This dataset will show Microsoft which movies do well in the industry by observing those with the highest rating and votes.

### Methods

This project used Exploratory Descriptive Analysis to understand 

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic for instructions on creating and submitting your deliverables. Refer to the rubric associated with this assignment for specifications describing high-quality deliverables.

### Key Points

* **Your analysis should yield three concrete business recommendations.** The ultimate purpose of exploratory analysis is not just to learn about the data, but to help an organization perform better. Explicitly relate your findings to business needs by recommending actions that you think the business (Microsoft) should take.

* **Communicating about your work well is extremely important.** Your ability to provide value to an organization - or to land a job there - is directly reliant on your ability to communicate with them about what you have done and why it is valuable. Create a storyline your audience (the head of Microsoft's new movie studio) can follow by walking them through the steps of your process, highlighting the most important points and skipping over the rest.

* **Use plenty of visualizations.** Visualizations are invaluable for exploring your data and making your findings accessible to a non-technical audience. Spotlight visuals in your presentation, but only ones that relate directly to your recommendations. Simple visuals are usually best (e.g. bar charts and line graphs), and don't forget to format them well (e.g. labels, titles).

## Getting Started

Please start by reviewing this assignment, the rubric at the bottom of it, and the "Project Submission & Review" page. If you have any questions, please ask your instructor ASAP.

Next, we recommend you check out [the Phase 1 Project Templates and Examples repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-project-template) and use the MVP template for your project.

Alternatively, you can fork [the Phase 1 Project Repository](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project), clone it locally, and work in the `student.ipynb` file. Make sure to also add and commit a PDF of your presentation to your repository with a file name of `presentation.pdf`.

## Project Submission and Review

Review the "Project Submission & Review" page in the "Milestones Instructions" topic to learn how to submit your project and how it will be reviewed. Your project must pass review for you to progress to the next Phase.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to develop your data science skills using real-world data. The end-of-phase projects are a critical part of the program because they give you a chance to bring together all the skills you've learned, apply them to realistic projects for a business stakeholder, practice communication skills, and get feedback to help you improve. You've got this!
